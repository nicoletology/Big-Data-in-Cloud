Basic understanding of Big Data and Cloud Infrastructures

In this repository, I share my knowledge on the Facilitating Role of Cloud Computing in Driving Big Data Emergence. The materials include: 

	- The Paper
	- The Presentation Slides
	- The Presentation Recording

This paper portrays the basic concepts for understanding on Big Data Technologies and Cloud Infrastructures. 

	i. Big data emerges as a technological breakthrough in computing technology, achieves efficient storage and effective processing of big data THROUGH parallel storage and parallel processing. BUT, the adoption requires new infrastructure to house the parallel computing hardwares and technology frameworks involving huge monetary investment, which can be a burden to small and medium enterprises as well as the startups. 
	ii. This is when cloud computing comes in as a solution. Cloud computing emerges an infrastructural breakthrough in computing technology. It VIRTUALISES the sophisticated infrastructures required for big data adoption, make the infrastructure accessible to the consumers as services through simple internet mechanism. 
	
These are addressed in the paper, which has been presented in SRC'21 (THE 3RD SUSTAINABILITY AND RESILIENCE CONFERENCE: CLIMATE CHANGE) conference. The conference proceeding published at IEEExplore in January 2022.
